# C Variables
```c

•	When variable is declared a memory allocation is done 
•	It is necessary  for compiler to know the the type of data that the variable will store , hence VARIABLE Is declared with its type
•	Declaration is necessary bcz C Iis statistical language 

Basic Syntax:
type variable_name;

int age;
float salary;
char grade;
double pi = 3.14159;

```

## More clarity on the declarartion

```c
---> int a =1 ;in this both declaration  of variable and intialisation is done 

---> b=1; this will give error called undeclared variable ,because declariang variable means u must specify the data type to it ,in this line only initialisation is done.
how will memory be allocated for above variables
